                Due to my interest in FX trading and engineering, I decided to
                spend some of my free time learning how to build algorithmic trading
                bots with python. Using the OANDA API, I was able to gain access to historical data to
                backtest typical retail trading strategies and run a trading bot.

                Tasked with building an app that would improve DEI in the workspace, I worked in a team of 3 to build
                an app that would allow colleagues to vote on ideas for social events. Note only the frontend is hosted
                and is not connected to the server, therefore the login/register functionality will not work.
